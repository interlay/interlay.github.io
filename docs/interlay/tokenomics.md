# INTR Tokenomics

Interlay will be governed by its community from day 1 - via INTR, Interlay’s governance token. 


?> _INTR tokens will be distributed to network participants, builders and early backers as airdrops and block-rewards. There will be no public sale or ICO._

Below is a summary of the Interlay token economy, as described in the [token economy whitepaper released by Kintsugi Labs](https://github.com/interlay/whitepapers).

## Key Functions of INTR

The INTR token’s main purposes are:

* **Governance**- INTR holders vote on governance proposals and elect council members to make operational decisions. 
* **Utility**. Mit-term, Interlay will support transaction fee payments in INTR and other digital assets, in addition to DOT. 

## Supply and Emission

INTR features an **unlimited supply**. The emission schedule is defined as follows: 

* 1 billion (1,000,000,000) INTR emitted over the first 4 years
* 2% annual inflation afterwards, indefinitely.


## Distribution

INTR will be controlled by the community:

* **70% is distributed to the community** as airdrops and block rewards.  
  - 30% as Vault rewards;
  - 10% as first crowdloan paradrop;
  - 25% to the on-chain Treasury;
  - 5% to stake-to-vote staking rewards.
* 20% to the Interlay team & early backers who funded the development of the protocol - subject to a 48-week cliff followed by 144 weeks of linear vesting.
* 10% to a Foundation reserve, to be used for funding ecosystem growth and future development.

Starting in year 5, the community receives 100% of newly minted INTR as part of the 2% annual inflation.
