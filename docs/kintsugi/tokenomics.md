# KINT Tokenomics

Kintsugi will be governed by its community from day 1 - via KINT, Kintsugi’s governance token. Kintsugi will go live via **a fair launch scheme**. 


_KINT tokens will be distributed to network participants, builders and early backers as airdrops and block-rewards. There will be no public sale or ICO._

Below is a summary of the Kintsugi token economy, as described in the [token economy whitepaper released by Kintsugi Labs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interlay/whitepapers/master/Kintsugi_Token_Economy.pdf).

### Key Functions of KINT

The KINT token’s main purposes are:

* **Governance**- KINT holders vote on governance proposals and elect council members to make operational decisions. 
* **Utility**. Mit-term, Kintsugi will support transaction fee payments in KINT and other digital assets, in addition to KSM. 

### Supply and Emission

KINT features an unlimited supply. The emission schedule is defined as follows: 



* 10 million KINT emitted over the first 4 years (4:3:2:1 million) 
* 2% annual inflation afterwards, indefinitely.

Specifically, the emission schedule for the first 6 years looks as follows:

### Distribution

KINT will be controlled by the community:

* **70% is distributed to the community** as airdrops and block rewards.  
  - 30% to Vault rewards;
  - 35% to the on-chain Treasury;
  - 5% to stake-to-vote staking rewards.
* 30% is airdropped to the Interlay team, and early & future investors, who funded the development of the protocol - subject to a 1-year cliff followed by 1-year linear vesting.

Starting in year 5, only the community receives new KINT from the annual inflation.

**Suggested On-Chain Treasury Reserve**

The on-chain Treasury reserve is in turn distributed as follows (suggestion - final allocation to be decided, from time to time, by Kintsugi community governance):

### Circulating Supply

Due to the nature of the stake-to-vote governance mechanism of KINT, it is impossible to accurately predict the circulating supply (holds actively participating in governance may decide to stake KINT for prolonged periods). In addition, the reserves controlled by the on-chain treasury may be distributed to foster project development and ecosystem growth, as determined by community governance (KINT holders). 


As such, the numbers below are **pure estimates and will very likely be subject to change over the first 2-3 years of the network's existence. Use with caution!**.
