# Interlay Network 101

## Introduction 

Interlay is a decentralized network dedicated to connecting crypto-currencies like Bitcoin with DeFi platforms like Polkadot and Ethereum. The Interlay network is hosted as a Polkadot parachain and will be connected to Cosmos, Ethereum and other major DeFi networks. Read more about Interlay’s vision of blockchain interoperability.

**[interBTC](/getting-started/overview?id=interbtc-bitcoin-on-any-blockchain)**, Interlay’s flagshipt product, is Bitcoin on any blockchain. A 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset, fully collateralized, interoperable, and censorship-resistant.

**[Kintsugi](../kintsugi/overview)** is Interlay’s canary network, an experiment with real economic value deployed on Kusama. Kintsugi and Interlay share the same code base - with the difference that Kintsugi focusses strictly on innovation and will always be ahead in terms of features. Read more about Interlay’s dual network model.
